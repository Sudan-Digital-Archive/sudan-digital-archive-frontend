    "who_are_we_para_1": "What do we mean by the term collective? It reflects the way we want to operate. The term 'collective' in our context refers to a group of individuals working together collaboratively, with shared responsibility and decision-making power. While we operate non-hierarchically and value every member's voice, we'recognize that building trust and rapport takes time and effort, especially given how deeply entrenched hierarchical structures are in many of our experiences.",

    "who_are_we_point_three": "Cultural resonance and community connection.",

    "why_another_archive_heading": "The Sudan Digital Archive distinguishes itself through its commitment to decolonial practices and its emergence from the transformative context of the Sudanese revolution.",
    "why_another_archive_para_one": "As a grassroots, Sudanese-led initiative, we prioritize local perspectives and knowledge systems, moving beyond the limitations of traditional institutional archives.",
    "why_another_archive_para_two": "Our approach to digital preservation is grounded in post-colonial theory and practice, ensuring that the collection, curation, and accessibility of materials reflect Sudanese ways of knowing and remembering.",

We strive to humanize the Sudanese experience by creating a comprehensive digital repository that not only preserves memory but also promotes a just future.",
    "mission_para_five": "Our commitment to transparency and accessibility is fundamental - all our code is open source, and our methodological documents, including our non-hierarchical collective way of working and code of conduct, are publicly accessible. We actively work to ensure our collections reach the widest possible audience through public events, conferences, and exhibitions that showcase our work and facilitate dialogue around these important materials.",
    "mission_para_six": "Our work is guided by innovative technical methodologies that address the unique challenges of modern digital content, from archiving dynamic web pages to efficiently identifying relevant content. However, technology serves our mission rather than driving it.",
    "mission_para_seven": "As a Sudanese-led initiative, all key decisions about content selection, storage methods, promotion strategies, and annotation practices center Sudanese perspectives and needs. We are committed to ensuring our collections remain as accessible as possible while respecting privacy and security considerations. Through this approach, we aim to provide a robust and trusted foundation for understanding Sudan's past and present, contributing to a more informed and equitable future for all Sudanese people.",
