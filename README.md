# Thoughts

- UIs are fiddly 
- I just need a good template
- It has to be with a good component library for a data heavy app
- The correct component library for that is rsuite so I should change that
- Next I have to get a good landing page for rsuite that doesn't look ugly
- So I should refactor out semantic UI and put rsuite back in
- Strip out the styles and try and make rsuite look nicer somehow
- Maybe go with their template

OK better idea - reuse the fken UI for your own website.
OR just find another similar template.
How did I find that one? I searched portfolio sites. So just do that.
